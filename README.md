#### By **Luke Bertram**

## Description

Track Suggester is a survey of interests designed to help a user determine which of the available courses of study at [Epicodus](http://epicodus.com) (a code school based in Seattle, WA and Portland, OR) might be the best fit for them.

Users answer the questions on the survey form and then submit this form. Upon submission, the page will reveal which track (_Ruby/Rails, PHP/Drupal, Java/Android, CSS/Design, or C#/.NET_) is the best fit for the user according to the answers provided.
